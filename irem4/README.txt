             Dust Emission Spectra from Draine & Li (2007) 

This directory contains results of theoretical modeling of infrared
emission from dust grains heated by starlight, as described in Draine
& Li (2007) -- please consult that paper for details.

In brief, the dust consists of a mixture of amorphous silicate grains
and carbonaceous grains.  The carbonaceous grains have the properties
of PAH molecules and ions when the effective radius a < 5.0nm, the
properties of graphite spheres when a >> 10 nm, and optical properties
intermediate between the properties of PAH particles and graphite
particles for 5 < a < 10 nm, as described by Draine & Li (2007).

The ionization fraction x_ion(a) of the PAH particles is assumed to be
the average for the diffuse ISM [see Figure 8 of Draine & Li (2007)].

Temperature distribution functions are calculated for all particles
small enough for quantized heating to be important; large grains are
treated as having steady-state temperatures determined by starlight
heating = radiative cooling.

Spectra are given for dust heated by starlight with the spectrum of
Mathis, Mezger, & Panagia (1983), scaled by a factor U.  U=1
corresponds to the starlight intensity estimate for the local ISM.
Band-averaged emissivities are also given for photometric bands used
by IRAS, COBE-DIRBE, Spitzer Space Telescope, Akari, and Herschel.

Spectra are given for 11 dust models:

  jm     name      q_PAH
  --   --------    ------
   1   MW3.1_00    0.47 %
   2   MW3.1_10    1.12 %
   3   MW3.1_20    1.77 %
   4   MW3.1_30    2.50 %
   5   MW3.1_40    3.19 %
   6   MW3.1_50    3.90 %
   7   MW3.1_60    4.58 %
   8   LMC2_00     0.75 %
   9   LMC2_05     1.49 %
  10   LMC2_10     2.37 %
  11   smc         0.10 %

q_PAH is the fraction of the total dust mass that is contributed by
PAH particles containing < 1000 C atoms.  All dust models use the dust
size distributions from Weingartner & Draine (2001), except for
adjustment of the parameters (a_01,a_02,sigma_1,sigma_2)
characterizing the PAH size distribution (see Draine & Li 2007, Table
2).

For each emission model, the dust is assumed to be exposed to a range
of radiation intensities, with the mass dM of dust exposed to
starlight intensities in [U,U+dU] being given by a power-law
distribution

   dM = const * U^{-2} * dU   for umin < U < umax

Results are available here for the following values of umin:

   umin= 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.70, 0.80, 1.00, 1.20,
   1.50, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 4.00, 5.00, 7.00, 8.00, 10.0, 12.0, 15.0,
   20.0, 25.0

and for the following values of umax:

   umax= 1e3, 1e4, 1e5, 1e6, 1e7

The model spectra are given in files

Uumin/Uumin_umax_modl.txt [e.g., U1.00/U1.00_1e6_MW3.1_60.txt ]

We also consider dust exposed to a single radiation intensity.  This
is simply the case where umax = umin.  These spectra are given in files

Uumin/Uumin_umin_modl.txt [e.g., U1.00/U1.00_1.00_MW3.1_60.txt ]

The files are ascii, and should be self-explanatory.  

Draine & Li (2007) propose fitting emission from galaxies, or large
regions within a galaxy, by a linear sum of emission from dust heated
by a single radiation intensity U=umin plus emission from dust heated
by a distribution of starlight intensities ranging from umin to umax,
with umax=1e6 appearing to often work well for star-forming galaxies.
The emission spectrum, expressed as emission per H nucleon, is then
simply

   j_nu = (1-gamma)*j_nu[umin,umin] + gamma*j_nu[umin,umax]

where gamma is the fraction of the total dust mass that is heated by
the distribution of starlight intensities [the remaining fraction
(1-gamma) is heated by starlight with U=umin], and j_nu[umin,umax] is
the emissivity from the file U$umin_umax_dustmod where dustmod is one
of {MW3.1_00, MW3.1_10, MW3.1_20, MW3.1_30, MW3.1_40, MW3.1_50,
MW3.1_60, LMC2_00, LMC2_05, LMC2_10, smc}.

Below this are some blank lines, followed by the emission spectrum
between 1 cm and 1 micron (lines 62 - 1062, in frequency steps of
10**0.004).  The quantities tabulated are nu* dP/d\nu (where \nu is
frequency, and P = power radiated per H nucleon) and j_\nu = power
radiated per H nucleon per unit frequency per steradian.  Obviously,
j_\nu = (1/4*\pi)*(dP/d\nu)
